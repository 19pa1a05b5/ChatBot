A full binary tree (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree) is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels of the tree are completely filled, except possibly the last level, which can be filled from the left to right.\"# Text = \"Inquire is a research project at Stanford University to design an intelligent biol- ogy textbook that allows for more advanced interactions with the text by students. Currently, a knowledge base supporting this functionality must be extracted man- ually, which is prohibitively time-consuming. In this project, we focused on an important initial approximation of the full knowledge base extraction problem: automatically extracting glossaries from a textbook. We scraped a new dataset for this task from open source science textbooks and achieved a corrected F1 score of 0.74 for extracting glossary terms and an F1 score of 0.47 for extracting glossary term definitions. Though these scores are not immediately usable, our work has provided a useful foundation for future work on the Inquire project.\"\n",
        "# Text = \"A domain glossary that organizes domain-specific concepts and their aliases and relations is essential for knowledge acquisition and software development. Existing approaches use linguistic heuristics or term-frequency-based statistics to identify domain specific terms from software documentation, and thus the accuracy is often low. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach for automatic construction of domain glossary from source code and software documentation. The approach uses a set of high-quality seed terms identified from code identifiers and natural language concept def- initions to train a domain-specific prediction model to recognize glossary terms based on the lexical and semantic context of the sentences mentioning domain-specific concepts.\"\n",
        "# Text = \"We introduce ArGoT, a data set of mathematical terms extracted from the articles hosted on the arXiv website. A term is any mathematical concept defined in an article. Using labels in the article’s source code and examples from other popular math websites, we mine all the terms in the arXiv data and compile a comprehensive vocabulary of mathematical terms. Each term can be then organized in a dependency graph by using the term’s definitions and the arXiv’s metadata. Using both hyperbolic and standard word embeddings, we demonstrate how this structure is reflected in the text’s vector representation and how they capture relations of entailment in mathematical concepts. This data set is part of an ongoing effort to align natural mathematical text with existing Interactive Theorem Prover Libraries (ITPs) of formally verified statements.\"\n",
        "# Text = \"Document keyphrases provide semantic metadata characterizing documents and producing an overview of the content of a document. They can be used in many text-mining and knowledge management related applications. This paper describes a Keyphrase Identification Program (KIP), which extracts document keyphrases by using prior positive samples of human identified domain keyphrases to assign weights to the candidate keyphrases. The logic of our algorithm is: the more keywords a candidate keyphrase contains and the more significant these keywords are, the more likely this candidate phrase is a keyphrase. To obtain prior positive inputs, KIP first populates its glossary database using manually identified keyphrases and keywords. It then checks the composition of all noun phrases of a document, looks up the database and calculates scores for all these noun phrases. The ones having higher scores will be extracted as keyphrases.\"\n",

This leads to correlations between observable physical properties of the systems. For example, it is possible to prepare two particles in a single quantum state such that when one is observed, the other must take on a complementary value, regardless of the distance between them. This behavior is independent of distance and holds true even when the measurements are performed simultaneously, leading to the phenomenon of quantum non-locality.\"\n",

This is achieved by using mathematical algorithms to convert plaintext into ciphertext. Cryptanalysis, on the other hand, is the process of breaking down encrypted messages without knowledge of the key.\""
